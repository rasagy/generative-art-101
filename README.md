## Getting Started
- :computer: [P5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org) for creating & running sketches
- :book: [P5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) for looking up commands & syntax, or [download & locally run the offline Reference](https://p5js.org/offline-reference/p5-reference.zip)
- :computer: [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org) to share your final projects that are easy to embed, and to look for more inspiration & examples
- :video_camera: [Daniel Shiffmanâ€™s Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/) has an incredible collection of tutorials. Start with [Intro to with P5.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) or [pick a topic-specific playlist](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=1&flow=grid)

- :video_camera: [Tutorial videos on Designing Generative Systems w/ P5.js](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0) â€” takes patterns from a brand and makes a generative system out of it

## Specific techniques
- ðŸ“¹ [Generative Art Speedrun by Tim Holman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk) â€“ great visual intro to the different generative techniques
- :black_nib: [Inconvergent: Anders Hoffâ€™s writings](https://inconvergent.net/generative/) on how he uses randomness, noise to create his projects
- :black_nib: [Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays) on how he recreates a painting-like aesthetic, explores color & broader thoughts on generative art as a field + Also check his talk on [recreating a watercolor aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R9eywArFTE)
- ðŸ“¹ [Box of Chaos: Generative Artistâ€™s Toolkit by Benjamin Kovach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZNTozzsNqk) â€” good talk walking through common generative techniques like random/perlin noise/color spaces & more

## Art movements & seminal artists
- [Selected pieces of renowned artists that explored geometric & abstract compositions](https://in.pinterest.com/rasagy/artists-abstract-geometric-modern/) â€” perfect to practice recreating and reanimating

## Inspiration
- ðŸ“¹ [Art of Creative Coding by PBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBV14-3LT-g) â€” short teaser about interesting projects in Processing/Cinder/openFrameworks
- ðŸ“¹ [Art of Code by Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U) â€” excellent introduction to the weird & weirder world of code for Rockstar developers!
